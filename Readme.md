# 🔁 Customer Loop

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Small businesses in Tier-2 and Tier-3 towns struggle to retain customers due to the absence of simple, affordable digital loyalty tools. Most shop owners rely on manual methods such as physical loyalty cards or memory, which are inefficient, error-prone, and do not scale with business growth.

## 💡 Solution Overview

**Customer Loop** is a **mobile-first loyalty management application** built using **Flutter** and **Firebase**.  
It helps small business owners digitally track repeat customers, record visits, and reward loyalty through a **points-based system**.

### 🔄 How Customer Loop Works
- Shop owners register and log in securely
- Customers are added and managed digitally
- Each visit earns reward points
- Points can be redeemed as:
  - **Instant discounts at the same shop**
  - **Products from an in-app rewards catalog** (MVP demo feature)

Firebase ensures **secure authentication** and **real-time data synchronization**, enabling instant updates across devices.
